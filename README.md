# Belden Project - Sample Codes
When Belden negotiates product prices with customers, there exists a trade-off between offering
high or low prices. High prices give high margin but diminish customer’s willingness to accept
the quote, whereas low prices are more likely to be accepted but Belden may lose opportunity
profits. We focus on the pricing decision in this project. Our team created two pricing model with
statistical algorithms that can optimize selling prices for all cable products and customers under
various order circumstances that can account for changing market, competitive, and cost
dynamics. Having this model allows for more control in setting the “right” prices that are
justifiable with a better price acceptance rate, and in turn, more predictability and control over
P&L performance.

This project has two parts: pricing tools with different models and the outlier analysis. The part I
explores relationship between price and demand, and find the optimal price maximizing the
profit. The part II focuses on those factors having significant impact on quotes. We consider
products from both the industrial cables (INCA) and network solutions (NWS) categories.
